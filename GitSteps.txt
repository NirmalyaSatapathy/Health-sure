Example path:
`C:\javaProgramming\Projects\nirmalya\Central-Project-Repo-HMS- - Copy (2)`

cd "/c/javaProgramming/Projects/nirmalya/Central-Project-Repo-HMS- - Copy (2)"
```

### 🚀 Step-by-step Git Push Workflow

#### 1️⃣ **Check current status:**

```bash
git status
```

This shows if you have modified or untracked files.

---

#### 2️⃣ **Stage all changes:**

```bash
git add .
```

This adds all new/modified files to the next commit.

---

#### 3️⃣ **Commit your changes:**

```bash
git commit -m "Describe what you updated"
```

> Example:
> `"Updated procedure and insurance modules"`

---

#### 4️⃣ **Push to GitHub:**

```bash
git push origin main
```

This sends your changes to your GitHub repo’s `main` branch.

### ✅ Final Output

If everything worked, you'll see something like:

```
To https://github.com/NirmalyaSatapathy/Health-sure.git
   abc1234..def5678  main -> main
